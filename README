--------------------------------------------------------------

Read the handout and use the sequential code as reference to study.
Use the other source files to parallelize with the proper programming model.

Edit the first lines in the Makefile to set your preferred compilers and flags
for both the sequential code and for each parallel programming model: 
OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA.

To see a description of the Makefile options execute:
$ make help 

Use the input files in the test_files directory for your first tests.
Students are encouraged to manually write or automatically generate
their own input files for more complete tests. See a description of
the input files format in the handout.
